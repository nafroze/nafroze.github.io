    <p>This is me, Nazia. I am a geographer currently pursuing my Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Geography and Geospatial Science at Oregon State University. My academic journey has been marked by hands-on experiences, research endeavors, and a commitment to making a positive impact in the field. I have a bachelor's degree in disaster management and a master's degree in geography with a focus on remote sensing and GIS. I am currently studying disaster-affected areas using satellite imagery</p>

        I am going to include random stuff here untill I figure out what I want to do with this page. So, stay tuned!
